Reddit Tf-idf for Gravity
By Yan

This script parses a subset of reddit 'subreddits'(listed below) and makes generalizations about what users of a subreddit might like, by using a TF-IDF score.
Outputs 25 random tidbits each time it is run.  Some gems are:
People from soccer probably like barcelona (tf-idf weight of 0.012517331)
People from soccer probably like goal (tf-idf weight of 0.009387998)
People from politics probably like legal (tf-idf weight of 0.003239006)
People from LosAngeles probably like ticket (tf-idf weight of 0.006754175)
People from politics probably like states (tf-idf weight of 0.001619503)
People from AdviceAnimals probably like chicken (tf-idf weight of 0.033204655)
People from gaming probably like steam (tf-idf weight of 0.015843364)
People from soccer probably like spending (tf-idf weight of 0.012517331)
People from starcraft probably like protoss (tf-idf weight of 0.020537694)
People from worldnews probably like troops (tf-idf weight of 0.002802010)

V 2.0 gems:
People from worldnews probably like troops (tf-idf weight of 0.002802010)
People from askreddit probably like go in their pants (tf-idf weight of 0.001647095)
People from politics probably like bill in their pants (tf-idf weight of 0.003099019)
People from iama probably like programmers in their pants (tf-idf weight of 0.003916086)
People from worldnews probably like cigarette in their pants (tf-idf weight of 0.002802010)


The sample size is sort of small so it's not very accurate and gets lots of false positives, but by adding more subreddits or using more information
from each subreddit we would weed out more of the junk words("why", "if", "and", etc.)
 
higher Tf-idf weights correspond with high relevance.
